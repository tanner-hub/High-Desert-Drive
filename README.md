# High-Desert-Drive
## https://highdesertdrive.com
> High desert drive is a web application I have been building in my spare time. The intention is to have an alternate way to transfer and manipulate personal files across devices without requiring a user to sign in or caching data.
> This project has combined my knowledge of JS, HTML, CSS, Apache, Flask, and Docker with python automation and restful APIs.
> This site is self hosted with SSL encryption on a personal Linux server, go-daddy domain.
> This site can be viewed at https://www.highdesertdrive.com
> Feel free to create an account and try it out.
> This site is still under active development.
